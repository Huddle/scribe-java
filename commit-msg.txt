Added HuddleApi support

There are problems with using Scribe for OAuth2, in particular the token
request MUST be a POST, must include a grant_type, and must expect a json
response.

Client_Secret is an *optional* field, since it offers no security benefit
for distributed clients.

* OAuth20Service adds access token parameters into a POST body, not a URL
** see http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-30#section-4.1.3
* Added required "grant_type=authorization_code" to access token requests
* Allowed whitespace in json reader
* Added "Accept" header with value of "application/json" to token requests
* Added HuddleApi class and example code
